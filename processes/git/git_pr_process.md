## PR Types & Decision Tree

### Overview of PR Types

Our workflow supports three distinct types of pull requests, each with specific purposes, naming conventions, and documentation requirements:

#### 1. Feature PRs 🚀

**Branch Flow**: `feature/<name>` → `development`

**Purpose**: Introduce new functionality or significant enhancements to existing features

**Characteristics**:
- Single feature or tightly-related set of changes
- Focused scope with clear functional boundaries
- Technical details are acceptable when needed
- Moderate documentation depth

**Naming Convention**:
```
feat: <Brief description>
Feature: <Name of feature>
```

**Examples**:
- `feat: Add WhatsApp QR code authentication`
- `Feature: Content templates for quick replies`

**Documentation Level**: **Medium**
- What was added (feature description)
- Why it was needed (business context)
- How to use/test it
- Related tickets/issues
- File-level details acceptable if clarifying complex changes

---

#### 2. Bug Fix/Hotfix PRs 🐛🔥

**Branch Flow**:
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/<name>` → `development`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/<name>` → `main`

**Purpose**: Correct errors, resolve issues, or apply critical production fixes

**Characteristics**:
- **Bug fixes**: Non-urgent fixes through normal workflow
- **Hotfixes**: Urgent production fixes bypassing development
- Narrow scope focused on the specific issue
- Clear before/after behavior description
- Root cause explanation (if relevant)

**Naming Convention**:
```
fix: <Brief description of what was fixed>
hotfix: <Critical issue description>
```

**Examples**:
- `fix: Resolve audio upload error in WhatsApp channels`
- `hotfix: Prevent duplicate reauthorization emails`

**Documentation Level**: **Focused**
- What was broken
- What was fixed
- Root cause (if known and relevant)
- How to verify the fix
- Related incident/issue references
- File-level details acceptable for hotfixes (context matters)

---

#### 3. Release PRs 🎉

**Branch Flow**: `development` → `main`

**Purpose**: Promote accumulated changes from development to production

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple features, fixes, and improvements
- Comprehensive scope covering a sprint/release cycle
- High-level, business-value focused documentation
- Stakeholder-friendly language
- Categorized by change type

**Naming Convention**:
```
Release: <Version/Sprint/Date> - <Key highlights>
```

**Examples**:
- `Release: Sprint 12 - WhatsApp Integration & UI Improvements`
- `Release: v2.3.0 - Assignment Policies & Captain Enhancements`
- `Release: 2025-10-12 - Q4 Feature Bundle`

**Documentation Level**: **Comprehensive & High-Level**
- Overview of entire release
- Changes categorized (Features, Fixes, Refactors, UI/UX, etc.)
- Business value focus (no technical jargon)
- NO file-level details (unless absolutely critical)
- Deployment notes and testing summary
- Breaking changes highlighted

---

### Decision Tree: Which PR Type Should I Use?

```
START: What are you merging?
    |
    ├─ Is this a production release? (development → main)
    |   └─ YES → [RELEASE PR]
    |
    ├─ Is this a critical production fix? (urgent, can't wait for normal cycle)
    |   └─ YES → [HOTFIX PR] (hotfix-branch → main)
    |
    ├─ Is this a bug fix? (non-urgent error correction)
    |   └─ YES → [BUG FIX PR] (bugfix-branch → development)
    |
    └─ Is this new functionality or enhancement?
        └─ YES → [FEATURE PR] (feature-branch → development)
```

## Key Principles

### Universal Principles (All PR Types)

1. **Right-Sized Documentation** - Match documentation depth to PR type: comprehensive for releases, focused for fixes, medium for features
2. **Clear Communication** - Write for your audience: stakeholders for releases, developers for features, incident responders for hotfixes
3. **Contextual Detail** - Use file-level details only when they clarify critical context (acceptable for features/hotfixes, avoid for releases)
4. **Traceable History** - All changes should reference commits, tickets, or incidents for audit trails

### Type-Specific Principles

**For Release PRs**:
- Categorized organization (Features, Fixes, Refactors, UI/UX, etc.)
- High-level business value focus
- NO file-level details unless absolutely critical
- Stakeholder-friendly language

**For Feature PRs**:
- Clear feature boundaries and scope
- Technical details welcome when helpful
- Business context for "why"
- Testing instructions

**For Bug Fix/Hotfix PRs**:
- Root cause identification (when known)
- Clear before/after behavior
- Verification steps
- Incident references (for hotfixes)

### Success Criteria

The process is successful when:
- [ ] PR type correctly identified
- [ ] Changes analyzed and understood
- [ ] Documentation matches PR type requirements
- [ ] PR created with appropriate title format
- [ ] Description provides necessary context for reviewers
- [ ] Base and head branches are correct

### Phase Summary Table

| Phase | Objective | Scope | Deliverable | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **0. Identify Type** | Determine which PR type | All | PR type decision | 1 min |
| **1. Analyze Changes** (Common) | Understand scope of changes | All | Categorized change list | 3-15 min* |
| **2. Create Summary** (Common) | Document changes appropriately | All | PR summary draft | 2-10 min* |
| **3. Create PR** (Type-Specific) | Format and submit PR | Varies by type | Active GitHub PR | 2-5 min |

*Duration varies by PR type: Feature (shorter), Release (longer)

### Prerequisites (All PR Types)

- [ ] On the correct source branch with proper naming convention
- [ ] All changes are committed
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with remote
- [ ] Push access to repository
- [ ] GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- [ ] Target branch exists (development or main)

### Branch Naming Convention

**Format**: `<type>/<description>` or `<type>-<description>`

**Valid Types** (matches semantic commit types):
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix` - Critical production fixes
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks, builds, releases
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Test additions or modifications
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `style` - Code style/formatting changes

**Examples**:
- `feat/whatsapp-qr-auth`
- `fix/audio-upload-error`
- `hotfix/duplicate-emails`
- `chore/bump-version-0.2.0`
- `docs/update-pr-process`
- `refactor/ai-backend-service`

**Notes**:
- Use kebab-case for descriptions (lowercase with hyphens)
- Keep branch names concise but descriptive
- Both `/` and `-` separators are acceptable (prefer `/` for consistency)
- Branch names don't need to match PR titles exactly, but should use the same type prefix

---

## Phase 1: Analyze Changes

**Objective**: Understand the complete scope of changes between the source and target branches

**Duration**: 3-15 minutes (varies by PR type)
- Feature PR: 3-5 minutes
- Bug Fix/Hotfix: 2-3 minutes
- Release PR: 10-15 minutes

**Applies To**: All PR types

### Step 1.1: Review Commit History

**Actions**:
1. Get the list of commits between target and source branches
2. Review commit messages to understand the nature of changes
3. Identify patterns (features, fixes, refactors, etc.)
4. For feature/bugfix: Usually 1-5 commits; for releases: many commits

**Tools/Commands**:
```bash
# Generic format (replace BASE and HEAD with your branches)
# BASE = target branch (where you're merging TO)
# HEAD = source branch (where you're merging FROM)
git log BASE..HEAD --oneline --no-merges

# Specific examples by PR type:

# Release PR (development → main)
git log main..development --oneline --no-merges

# Feature PR (feature/my-feature → development)
git log development..feature/my-feature --oneline --no-merges

# Hotfix PR (hotfix/critical-fix → main)
git log main..hotfix/critical-fix --oneline --no-merges

# Get detailed commit messages
git log BASE..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" --no-merges

# Count number of commits
git rev-list --count BASE..HEAD
```

**Common Issues**:
- **Issue 1**: Too many commits to review manually → Group by keywords (fix, feat, refactor, CU-)
- **Issue 2**: Unclear commit messages → Review the actual diffs for those commits

### Step 1.2: Analyze Code Differences

**Actions**:
1. Review the diff statistics to understand scope of changes
2. Identify which areas of the codebase were modified most
3. Look for patterns in file changes
4. For release PRs: Focus on high-level patterns
5. For feature/bugfix PRs: Review specific changes more closely

**Tools/Commands**:
```bash
# Generic format
git diff BASE...HEAD --stat
git diff BASE...HEAD --shortstat
git diff BASE...HEAD --name-only

# Specific examples:
# Release PR
git diff main...development --stat

# Feature PR
git diff development...feature/my-feature --stat

# Hotfix PR
git diff main...hotfix/critical-fix --stat
```

**Common Issues**:
- **Issue 1**: Too many files changed (Release PRs) → Focus on high-level patterns, not individual files
- **Issue 2**: Large diffs → Use `--stat` instead of full diff output
- **Issue 3**: Need specific file details → Acceptable for Feature/Hotfix PRs, avoid for Release PRs

### Step 1.3: Categorize Changes

**Actions**:
1. Group changes based on PR type requirements
2. Identify ticket/issue references (e.g., CU-xxxxx, incident IDs)
3. Note any breaking changes or major updates

**Categorization by PR Type**:

**Release PRs** - Comprehensive categorization:
- **Features**: New functionality added
- **Fixes**: Bug fixes and error corrections
- **Refactors**: Code improvements without functional changes
- **UI/UX**: User interface and experience improvements
- **Tests**: Test additions or modifications
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, deployment, configuration changes
- **Integrations**: Third-party service integrations

**Feature PRs** - Simpler categorization:
- What was added/changed (main feature)
- Related changes (supporting modifications)
- Tests (if any)

**Bug Fix/Hotfix PRs** - Issue-focused:
- What was broken
- What was fixed
- Related changes (if any)

### Deliverable

**Output**: Categorized list of changes between branches

**Quality Check**:
- [ ] All commits have been reviewed
- [ ] Changes are grouped into logical categories
- [ ] Major themes/patterns are identified
- [ ] Breaking changes (if any) are noted

---

## Phase 2: Create PR Summary

**Objective**: Document all changes in a structured, reviewable format appropriate for the PR type

**Duration**: 2-10 minutes (varies by PR type)

- Bug Fix/Hotfix: 2-3 minutes
- Release PR: 5-10 minutes

**Applies To**: All PR types

### Step 2.1: Create Summary Document Structure

**Actions**:
1. Create a new PR summary document (can be temporary or stored)
2. Use the categorization from Phase 1
3. Write descriptions appropriate for PR type (see below)

**Document Structure by PR Type**:

**Release PR** (Comprehensive, high-level):
```markdown

- **Issue 2**: No permission → Check GitHub access rights
- **Issue 3**: PR already exists → Update existing PR or close it first
- **Issue 4**: Wrong base branch → Verify with `git branch --show-current` and decision tree

**After PR Creation**:
1. Open PR in browser: `gh pr view --web`
2. Verify base and head branches are correct
3. Add reviewers: `gh pr edit --add-reviewer @username`
4. Add appropriate labels
5. Share PR link with team
6. Monitor for review feedback

---

## Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Do's ✅
1. **Review Before Documenting**: Always review changes before writing the summary to understand the full scope
2. **Use Consistent Categorization**: Stick to the standard categories for consistency across PRs
3. **Focus on Business Value**: Write descriptions that non-technical stakeholders can understand
4. **Keep It Concise**: One line per change; avoid paragraphs of explanation
5. **Link to Issues**: Include ticket/issue references where applicable (e.g., CU-xxxxx)
6. **Proofread**: Check for typos and clarity before creating the PR

#### Don'ts ❌
1. **Don't List Files**: Avoid mentioning specific file paths in the summary
2. **Don't Skip Categories**: If a category has no changes, omit it entirely rather than leaving it empty
3. **Don't Rush**: Take time to properly categorize and document changes
4. **Don't Use Jargon**: Avoid overly technical language that obscures the business value
5. **Don't Forget Context**: Ensure reviewers have enough information to understand why changes were made

### For Reviewers

#### Do's ✅
1. **Read Summary First**: Start with the PR summary to understand scope before diving into code
2. **Verify Categorization**: Ensure changes are properly categorized
3. **Check for Completeness**: Verify all major changes are documented
4. **Test Locally**: Pull the branch and test critical functionality
5. **Provide Constructive Feedback**: Focus on improving the PR, not criticizing

| Issue | Symptoms | Quick Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Too many commits** | Cannot review all commits manually | Group by keywords, focus on patterns | Regular smaller releases |
| **PR already exists** | Error when creating PR | Close old PR or update it | Check existing PRs first |
| **Branch not pushed** | Cannot create remote PR | Run `git push -u origin development` | Push before creating PR |
| **Unclear commit messages** | Cannot categorize changes | Review actual diffs for context | Enforce commit message standards |
| **Missing context** | Reviewers ask too many questions | Add more detail to PR description | Include "why" for major changes |
| **Wrong base branch** | PR created against wrong branch | Close and recreate with correct base | Double-check branch in command |
| **PR title lint fails** | "Lint PR" check fails | Use semantic commit format (see below) | Follow PR title conventions |

### PR Title Lint Check Failures

**Symptom**: The "Lint PR / Validate PR title" GitHub check fails

**Cause**: PR title doesn't follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format

**Valid PR Title Format**:
```
<type>: <description>
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Valid Types**:
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `chore` - Maintenance, builds, releases
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Test changes
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `style` - Code style changes
- `build` - Build system changes
- `revert` - Revert previous changes

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ `release: v0.2.0` - **Invalid** (`release` is not a valid type)
- ✅ `chore(release): v0.2.0` - **Valid** (use `chore` for releases)
- ❌ `Release: Sprint 12` - **Invalid** (capitalized, invalid type)
- ✅ `chore: release Sprint 12` - **Valid** (lowercase `chore`)
- ❌ `Add new feature` - **Invalid** (missing type prefix)
- ✅ `feat: add new feature` - **Valid**

**How to Fix**:
1. Go to your PR on GitHub
2. Click "Edit" on the PR title
3. Update to follow `<type>: <description>` format
4. Use lowercase for type prefix
5. The check will re-run automatically

**Note**: The lint check validates PR **titles** only, not branch names or commit messages.

### When to Escalate

- **Large Breaking Changes**: Notify team lead before creating PR
- **Urgent Releases**: Follow hotfix process instead of standard process
- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve before creating PR or document conflicts clearly
- **Failed CI/CD**: Ensure all checks pass before requesting review

## Overview

The Research Process is the **critical first phase** before creating a design document. It ensures that:
1. The user's request is fully understood
2. The codebase and architecture are deeply analyzed
3. Multiple solution approaches are considered
4. The best approach is collaboratively selected
5. A solid foundation exists for the design phase

### Document Location

**IMPORTANT**: All research reports MUST be created in `/docs/ignored/design/`

- Research reports are NOT committed to the repository
- Templates remain in `/docs/processes/design/` for reference
- File naming: `/docs/ignored/design/<feature_name>_research.md`

### Key Principles

1. **Conversation First**: Research is collaborative, not automated
2. **Deep Understanding**: Use `@ultrathink` - read ALL relevant code
3. **Question Everything**: Challenge assumptions, ask clarifying questions
4. **Explore Alternatives**: Always present multiple approaches
5. **Align with Patterns**: Follow existing codebase conventions (Redux Toolkit, React Native, Tailwind)
6. **Document Findings**: Create clear, actionable research reports
7. **Mobile-First Thinking**: Consider both iOS and Android implications
8. **Platform Compatibility**: Verify iOS and Android compatibility

## Research Agent Responsibilities

### The Research Agent Must:

1. **Act as a Consultant** - Not just execute, but advise and guide
2. **Be Thorough** - Read ALL relevant code, don't make assumptions
3. **Be Conversational** - Engage the user, ask questions, discuss
4. **Be Critical** - Question the request if better approaches exist
5. **Be Comprehensive** - Consider all components (Redux slices, Services, Actions, Selectors, Components, Hooks, i18n, Tests)
6. **Be Pattern-Aware** - Identify and follow Redux Toolkit and React Native patterns
7. **Be Platform-Conscious** - Think about both iOS and Android implications
8. **Be Honest** - Admit uncertainty, ask for help when needed
9. **Document Everything** - Findings, conversations, decisions

### The Research Agent Should NOT:

1. **Jump to Implementation** - No code changes during research
2. **Make Unilateral Decisions** - Always collaborate with the user
3. **Skip Analysis** - Every request deserves deep investigation
4. **Ignore Alternatives** - Always present multiple options
5. **Assume Understanding** - Ask clarifying questions liberally
6. **Violate Architecture** - Respect Redux and React Native patterns
7. **Forget UI** - State changes often need UI component updates
8. **Skip Platform Checks** - Always verify iOS and Android compatibility

---

## Research Process Workflow

### Duration: 30-90 minutes

### Input:
- User's feature request or problem statement
- Access to codebase

### Output:
- Research report with findings and recommendation
- User approval to proceed to design phase

---

## Phase 1: Request Understanding

**Goal**: Fully understand what the user wants to achieve

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

### Step 1.1: Initial Request Parsing

**Actions**:
1. Read the user's request carefully
2. Identify the core objective
3. Note any mentioned constraints
4. Flag ambiguous or unclear points

**Example Questions to Ask Yourself**:
- What is the user trying to achieve?
- Is this a new feature, bug fix, refactoring, or optimization?
- Are there explicit requirements?
- Are there implicit requirements I should clarify?
- What is the scope? (API only? Full-stack? Database changes? Frontend UI?)

### Step 1.2: Clarification Questions

**Always Ask**:
- Scope clarification (state management? UI components? both?)
- Success criteria
- Constraints (timeline, backward compatibility, platform compatibility, etc.)
- Context (why is this needed? what problem does it solve?)
- i18n requirements (UI labels? translations needed?)
- Platform requirements (iOS only? Android only? both?)

**Example Conversation**:
```
User: "I want to add a priority indicator to conversations in the list"

Agent: "I'd like to understand your request better:

1. What is the purpose of the priority indicator?
2. What values should it have? (low/medium/high? numeric?)
3. Is this data already in the API response?
4. How should it be displayed? (color badge? icon? label?)
5. Should users be able to filter by priority?
6. Where should it appear? (conversation list only? detail view too?)
7. Should it work on both iOS and Android?
8. Are there any specific design requirements?
9. Does the backend API already support this?

Understanding these details will help me propose the best implementation approach."
```

### Step 1.3: Define Success Criteria

**Collaborate with User to Define**:
- What "done" looks like
- Acceptance criteria
- Performance requirements (if applicable)
- Testing expectations (Jest)
- Documentation needs
- i18n requirements (src/i18n/)
- Platform compatibility (iOS/Android)

**Document**:
```markdown
### Success Criteria
- [ ] Priority data available in Redux store
- [ ] Priority indicator component created
- [ ] Priority badge displays in conversation list
- [ ] Priority filter works in conversation filter
- [ ] All tests pass (Jest)
- [ ] i18n translations added
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android
```

### Deliverable:
- Clear, unambiguous understanding of the request
- Documented success criteria
- User confirmation that you understand correctly

---

## Phase 2: Repository Analysis

**Goal**: Deeply understand the current codebase and architecture

**Duration**: 20-40 minutes

### Step 2.1: Identify Relevant Code

**Use Tools Extensively**:
```bash
# Find relevant files - Redux state
Glob: "src/store/**/conversation*.ts"
Glob: "src/store/conversation/*.ts"

# Find relevant files - Components
Glob: "src/screens/**/Conversation*.tsx"
Glob: "src/components-next/**/*conversation*.tsx"

# Search for patterns
Grep: "conversationSlice"
Grep: "fetchConversations"
Grep: "ConversationList"

# Read all relevant files
Read: src/store/conversation/conversationSlice.ts
Read: src/screens/conversations/ConversationList.tsx
```

**Questions to Answer**:
- Where is the relevant code?
- What components are involved? (Redux slices, Services, Actions, Selectors, Components, Hooks, Navigation, i18n)
- What patterns are used?
- Are there similar features I can learn from?
- Are there platform-specific considerations?

### Step 2.2: Study Architecture Patterns

**Read**:
1. CLAUDE.md - Project guidelines
2. README_CHATSCOMMERCE.md - Setup and environment
3. Related Redux slice files
4. Related Redux service files
5. Related Redux action files
6. Related Redux selector files
7. Related React Native component files
8. Related screen files
9. Related hook files
10. Related i18n files (src/i18n/)
11. Related test files (Jest)
12. Related navigation files

**Analyze**:
- How are similar features implemented?
- What design patterns are used?
- How are Redux slices structured? (createSlice, reducers, extraReducers)
- How are Redux actions structured? (createAsyncThunk pattern)
- How are services structured? (static methods, API calls)
- How are React components structured? (functional components, hooks, Tailwind)
- How is Redux state organized? (slices, combined reducers)
- How is i18n managed? (I18n.t() usage)
- How is navigation structured? (React Navigation, stack/tab navigators)

### Step 2.3: Identify Dependencies & Impact

**Map Out**:
1. **Direct Dependencies** - What files import/use the affected code?
2. **Indirect Dependencies** - What features depend on this?
3. **State Management Impact** - Redux state changes needed? Migration strategy?
4. **API Integration Impact** - API changes needed? Backend coordination required?
5. **UI Impact** - React Native components, screens, navigation, i18n?
6. **Test Impact** - What tests need updates? (Jest)
7. **Platform Impact** - iOS-specific? Android-specific? Both?
8. **Native Module Impact** - New native dependencies? Permissions?

**Use Tools**:
```bash
# Find all references
Grep: "conversationSlice" --output-mode files_with_matches
Grep: "fetchConversations" --output-mode files_with_matches

# Check test files
Glob: "src/store/**/specs/*conversation*.spec.ts"
Glob: "src/screens/**/specs/*Conversation*.spec.tsx"

# Check for platform-specific code
Grep: "Platform.OS" --output-mode content
```

### Step 2.4: Review Similar Implementations

**Find Examples**:
- Look for similar features in the codebase
- Study how they were implemented
- Note patterns and conventions
- Learn from their design decisions

### Deliverable:
- Comprehensive understanding of current architecture
- List of affected files (backend + frontend)
- Identified patterns and conventions
- Impact assessment (database, API, frontend, tests, Enterprise)
- Examples of similar implementations
